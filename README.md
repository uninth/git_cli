# gitlab cli

This is a _works for me_ project while testing git / gitlab. I'd like to create 
a new project from the command line, update existing project - also from the
command line - on different versions of git and operating systems. I started
out in shell (an error) but it works ok, except that the creation requires token
on gitlab which is a security issue. Testing with github has not been done yet.

While this is public available it is not ment for production nor publication; use
if you like but don't blame me for anything.

See source for more info.
